# Single Box Bouncy Balls

I decided to code this little app after I saw this game on X and wanted to try making it myself.  

It's a small experiment with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** using the **Canvas API**.  

## How it works

- There's a single square (box) on the screen.  
- A hole moves along the bottom of the box.  
- Balls bounce inside the box like rubber balls.  
- If a ball falls into the hole, **two new balls spawn**.  
- The ball count is displayed above the canvas.
